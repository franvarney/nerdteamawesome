            <span id="aboutText">NTA stands for Nerd Team Awesome. We're nerds and we're here to help you. We love technology, and we'd love to make you love it too. While other people were out getting their nails done, brushing up on the latest celebrity trends, or enjoying the victory of their favorite regional sporting team, we were playing with electronics - taking them apart and putting them back together, researching the newest technology trends, and making sure we could out-geek our competitors. We're Nerd Team Awesome, and we want to help you.</span>
