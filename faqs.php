            <h4 class="italic">How long will it take for my item to be repaired?</h4><br />
            It depends on what's wrong with it, but generally speaking we can repair an item in one to two weeks.
        </div>
        <div class="faq">
            <h4 class="italic">Is there anything I need to do to help you?</h4><br />
            You don't even have to tell us how the item was broken if you don't want. We'll perform a diagnosis before we issue 
            you a quote, you just have to sit back and wait. 
        </div>
        <div class="faq">
            <h4 class="italic">How will I know the item has been fixed?</h4><br />
            We will let you know by e-mail or a phone call to let you know the item is functioning.
        </div>
        <div class="faq">
            <h4 class="italic">Anything else I need to know?</h4><br />
            Not really. The process on your end is relatively straightforward, just drop off the item with 
            us (or arrange for an on-site repair) and let us do our job. When the work is completed we'll 
            provide you with an invoice, and when the invoice is settled we'll return your item to you.
